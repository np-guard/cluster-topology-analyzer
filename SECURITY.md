# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

Each release is supported until there are two newer releases. For example, v1.3 was supported until the release of v1.5, and v1.4 was supported until the release of v1.6. Fixing critical problems in supported releases is done by issuing patch revisions (for example, v1.3.1, v1.3.2, and so on).
